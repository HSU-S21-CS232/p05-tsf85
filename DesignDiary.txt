I over-complicated this project from the very start. I spent days just trying to figure out
all the syntax, and rewatching the class videos. I was trying all sorts of things to try and
get the searches for album and genre id's to be more specific, so it didin't return everything
with a '1' in it for example. I had also pretty much given up on making one function to find
the ID for the searches and use that to search through tracks, but then I found the SQLite
query tutorial and realized I was working too hard... It's pretty neat how you can just make
a sql variable run searches through all those tables and fine tune them to get what you want.

I was playing with making a a page error code if you weren't logged in which I just didn't 
really get it and moved on to finish more of the basic requirements, and abandoned making
logging in a requirement for checkout.

There's still plenty of things I don't really understand for a lot of what I was using your
starting code to work from. Just about everything in the database is basically magic to me,
and I had to ask friends for help with expanding that when certain functions wouldn't work.

I completed all of the basic requirements and will continue to work on additionals and upload
them if you don't get right around to grading.
